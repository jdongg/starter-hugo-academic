title = "Applied Math Mentoring Program"
+++

The Applied Mathematics Undergraduate/Graduate Mentoring Program was co-founded by [Amanda Howard](http://www.dam.brown.edu/people/aah/aah.html) and [Steph Dodson](http://www.dam.brown.edu/people/sdodson/index.html). Undergraduate students concentrating in Applied Math are paired with graduate students with similar interests for an academic year. The goal of this program is to provide undergraduates with an additional advising perspective, particularly as it pertains to academic and career goals. We are interested in addressing issues that arise when students feel isolated and/or underrepresented in the Applied Math community. 

The program is particularly helpful for students interested in attending graduate school, although many students simply find it enjoyable to meet and forge connections with graduate students in the department.

I am organizing the mentoring program for the 2019-2020 academic year. If you are an undergraduate interested in participating or a graduate student interested in mentoring, you can contact me by email to sign up.
