I am a third year Ph.D. student in the Division of Applied Mathematics at Brown University. My research interests include scientific computing and numerical analysis of high-order methods for PDEs, especially as they pertain to problems in computational fluid dynamics. Presently, I am researching the use of deep neural networks to solve PDEs with my advisor, Professor [Mark Ainsworth](https://www.brown.edu/academics/applied-mathematics/mark-ainsworth). I am a recipient of the NSF Graduate Research Fellowship.

I am interested in increasing the participation of historically underrepresented groups in higher mathematics. Currently, I organize both the [APMA Directed Reading Program](http://www.dam.brown.edu/drp/index.html) and Mentoring Program.
